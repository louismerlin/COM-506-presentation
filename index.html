### 1. What is a jailbreak ?
### 2. How did this exploit start ?
### 3. How does the jailbreak work ?

# 1. What is a jailbreak ?
???
First, what do I mean by jailbreak ?
--

### - Privilege escalation on Apple's iOS
???
It typically involves some kind of privilege escalation on iOS, making the user root and able to bypass most of Apple's built in limitations.
--

### - Mobile carrier unlocking and device customization
???
A big usage of jailbreaking used to be for mobile carrier unlocking, if you wanted to switch your mobile carrier, say, from Swisscom to Salt or the other way around.
It is also used to install apps that are not on the Apple App Store, and tweak your device in different ways. I remember on one of the first versions of iOS, I used jailbreaking to change the background image of my iPod Touch from the only choice, black, to some picture I found cool at the time.
--

### - First jailbreak came out a few days after the first iPhone (2007)
???
Jailbreaks have played a big role in the iPhone from the beginning, as the first jailbreak was published only a few days after the release of the first iPhone. Since then, Apple has upgraded the security of the hardware and the software significantly. Some current versions of iOS and the iPhone have no public jailbreaks.

# 2.How did this exploit start ?
???
